  "summary": "I am currently an M.Sc. student in Computer Science at Koç University (Istanbul), where I work under the supervision of Prof. Alptekin Küpçü. My research centers on password-based authentication protocols, SMPC-based designs, and performance-driven cryptographic engineering. My work combines rigorous security arguments with real-world benchmarking, including Rust/Go implementations and Dockerized experimental frameworks. I graduated from the Polytechnic University of Tehran with an M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics, where my research focused on quantum error correction and surface codes. I also worked on quantum kernels for neural networks using Qiskit and PyQuil.",
